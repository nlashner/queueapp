# Queue 

Queue is a Google Chorome extension and fullstack web application that allows users to save and aggregate music from any website so they can listen to it at a later time. Queue was born from the confusion of multiple text threads with a lot of music being passed around, and myself not having time in the moment to listen to it, and then when I was ready, not being able to find where it had been sent.  With Queue, users can save these tracks with a click of a button to one single place (their "Queue"), and then go to their Queue when they're ready to rock.

The front end interface is built using React, Redux, and CSS.  The back end uses PostgreSQL for data storage, RESTful API routes written in Express to communicate user's actions to the database via Sequqlize ORM.  

This project is still a WIP and I look forward to contiue working on it and lauching it on the app store and as a PWA soon.  The repo for the chrome extension can be found [here][https://github.com/nlashner/queue]
