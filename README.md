# Queue 

ðŸŽ§ Queue is a Google Chrome extension and fullstack web application that allows users to save and aggregate music from any website so they can listen to it at a later time. ðŸŽ§

Queue was born from the confusion of multiple text threads with a lot of music being passed around, and myself not having time in the moment to listen to it, and then when I was ready, not being able to find where it had been sent.  With Queue, users can save these tracks with a click of a button to one single place (their "Queue"), and then go to their Queue when they're ready to rock.

The front end interface is built using `React`, `Redux`, and `CSS`.  The back end uses `PostgreSQL` for data storage and `RESTful API` routes written in Express to communicate user's actions to the database via `Sequelize`.  

This project is still a WIP and I look forward to contiue working on it and lauching it on the Chrome app store soon.  The repo for the Chrome extension can be found [here](https://github.com/nlashner/queue)
